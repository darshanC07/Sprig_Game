# Maze - Sprig game

My Game is about a Simple Maze...A maze is a complex network of paths or passages, typically designed as a puzzle or challenge, where the goal is to find a route from the entrance to the exit. Mazes vary widely in complexity and size, often found in games, puzzles, or architectural designs. Also to make the game interesting, I have provided a feature to collect coins. Players can collect coins and at the end, the total coins collected by the player will be displayed.
